One interesting consequence of a distributed transaction system is the there it is very difficult to apply any type of stabilization mechanisms to an economic currency. I believe this to be of fundamental importance as such policies can provide slower feedback systems to a system that responds rapidly to any fluctuation caused by change in investor and user sentiment, security breaches, or other general fluctuations. I believe that providing a mechanism for regulating such economic transactions would be beneficial in their widespread adaption, which I believe to be an inherently good thing.


However, one of the big challenges about how to regulate such a system, is how can one regulate an electonic currency? I propose one reasonably simple approach, mostly as a thought experiment*

To summasize, the key elements are:

* a method to identify the location of the user, providing an initial (untrusted) location
* a method of validating the untrusted location of the user, through a peer network
* the application of the appropriate monitary policy based on the location of the user

This also presupposes that we can split the world into 10km grids, that a global body that applies monetary policies to each grid.




* thanks to zwarg and sze for their useful ideas while discussing this idea with them
